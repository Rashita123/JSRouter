# JSRouter
**Simply create Single Page Applications using JS-Router-DOM.**

**React Router** is a default library used while workign with Single Page Applications(SPA) in React. 

Ever tried building a SPA using Vanilla JavaScript? 

`Js-router-dom` will take care of the routing side of the SPA. It's easy to use and available on npm for installation. 

# SPA-using-JS
I tried to implement **Routing** in a **single page application** using **Vanilla JavaScript**.
[Live Demo](https://routing-using-js.netlify.app/)
[Source Code](https://github.com/Rashita123/Routing-using-JS/)

- Navigate throughout the SPA, WITHOUT page re-load
- PrivateRoutes implemented 
- History [You can go back and forth with the links]
- Redirects if not authenticated.
- 404 page, for wrong links
- Authentaication for Private Routes.
